npm run test:integration
```

### Day 2: Feature Completion
```bash
# 1. Enable production features
npm run build

# 2. Run full test suite
npm test

# 3. Deploy to staging
docker-compose up
```

### Day 3: Akash Deployment
```bash
# 1. Build and push images
./scripts/akash-deploy.sh

# 2. Monitor deployment
akash provider lease-logs

# 3. Verify all services
```

### Day 4: Demo & Submission
