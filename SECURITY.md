- CVE-2023-45857: Cross-Site Request Forgery
**Fix:** Forced axios to v1.8.2 via package overrides

### 3. BigInt Buffer Overflow
**Package:** `bigint-buffer`  
**Issue:** CVE-2025-3194: Buffer overflow in `toBigIntLE()` function  
**Fix:** Forced to v2.0.0 via package overrides

### 4. IPFS Dependencies
**Package:** `ipfs-http-client` and related packages  
**Issues:** Multiple vulnerabilities in IPFS ecosystem  
**Fix:** Updated to latest secure versions

### 5. Nanoid Predictability
**Package:** `nanoid`  
**Issue:** Predictable results when given non-integer values  
**Fix:** Forced to v5.0.9 via package overrides

### 6. Parse Duration ReDoS
**Package:** `parse-duration`  
**Issue:** Regex Denial of Service vulnerability  
**Fix:** Forced to v2.1.3 via package overrides

## 🔧 Fix Implementation

### Package Overrides Strategy

We implemented a dual-strategy approach using both `overrides` (npm) and `resolutions` (yarn) to ensure secure dependency versions throughout the entire dependency tree:

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "axios": "^1.8.2",
    "bigint-buffer": "^2.0.0",
    "@solana/buffer-layout-utils": "^0.2.1",
    "@solana/spl-token": "^0.4.8",
    "nanoid": "^5.0.9",
    "parse-duration": "^2.1.3",
    "ipfs-core-utils": "^0.14.4",
    "ipfs-http-client": "^60.0.2",
    "interface-datastore": "^8.2.11"
  }
}
```

### Security Fix Script

Run the comprehensive security fix script:

```bash
npm run security:fix
```

This script:
1. 📦 Backs up current package-lock.json
2. 🧹 Cleans npm cache and node_modules
3. 📥 Reinstalls with security overrides
4. 🔍 Runs security audit
5. 🧪 Verifies TypeScript compilation
6. 📋 Generates security report

## ⚙️ Security Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run security:check` | Check for moderate+ vulnerabilities |
| `npm run security:update` | Update dependencies and fix vulnerabilities |
| `npm run security:fix` | Run comprehensive security fix script |
| `npm run audit:full` | Full audit and fix process |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | Check for high+ severity issues |

## 🎯 Production Security

### Current Security Status: ✅ SECURE

- ✅ All critical vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ All high-severity vulnerabilities resolved  
- ✅ All moderate vulnerabilities resolved
- ✅ Package overrides prevent regression
- ✅ Automated security checking in place

### Ongoing Security Practices

#### 1. Regular Auditing
```bash
# Weekly security check
npm run security:check

# Monthly comprehensive audit
npm run audit:full
```

#### 2. Dependency Management
- Package overrides prevent vulnerable versions
- Both npm and yarn package managers supported
- Automated security updates via package overrides

#### 3. CI/CD Integration
Add to your CI pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Security Audit
  run: npm audit --audit-level=high
```

## 📊 Risk Assessment

### ✅ Mitigated Risks

1. **Buffer Overflow Attacks** - Fixed via bigint-buffer v2.0.0
2. **CSRF Attacks** - Fixed via axios v1.8.2
3. **SSRF Attacks** - Fixed via axios v1.8.2
4. **DoS Attacks** - Fixed via parse-duration v2.1.3
5. **Predictable ID Generation** - Fixed via nanoid v5.0.9

### 🛡️ Additional Security Measures
